# UsToo
Pearl Hacks 2018 Hackathon Project

The modern digital age has brought about an explosion of interest in feminist philosophy, activism, and news. However, it's easy to get caught up in everyday life and completely get out of the loop about what's going on in feminism. 

For some of us our interest was piqued at Women's March 2017, for others decades before. Whatever your interest, whatever your background, UsToo will help you stay up to day in a stress-free and organic way.

For the tech stack, we used a combination of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build this Chrome extension. We also enjoyed working with the Twitter and Google Calendar API's. The Bootstrap library was a help as always!
